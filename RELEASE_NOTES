jMonad Release Notes
====================

### Version 0.1 March 24th, 2010
--------------------------------

This is the initial release. The documentation does not exist, so don't go
looking for it.  I've been really busy on a complex project and do not have the
time to document this project yet. However, this little JavaScript Monad
library has helped me tremendously.  As soon as I get it behind me, I'll be
telling the world about monads in JavaScript.
