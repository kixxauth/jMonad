jMonad Release Notes
====================

### Version 0.2 April 1st, 2010
-------------------------------

This is the second release. The only documentation for this project so far is
the comments in test/index.hml so make sure to browser through the tests and
comments in that file.

New in this release, monad initialization as well as all monad method
invocations go onto a stack which pushed them onto the native event loop for
later execution. This limits performance of jMonad compositions, but gives
control back to the native loop of the browser.

Use of the event loop also allowed for a monad to be handled like a
deferred/promise which is quite handy.

For this release, the broadcaster/observer helpers were removed as were the
push() and block() methods. There are no longer any methods attached to a monad
function when it is created other than specified by a call to .extend().

In the spirit of minimalism, all other functionality should be added with
plugins that use .extend();

### Version 0.1 March 24th, 2010
--------------------------------

This is the initial release. The documentation does not exist, so don't go
looking for it.  I've been really busy on a complex project and do not have the
time to document this project yet. However, this little JavaScript Monad
library has helped me tremendously.  As soon as I get it behind me, I'll be
telling the world about monads in JavaScript.
