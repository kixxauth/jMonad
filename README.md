Monadic JavaScript
------------------

### *Release Candidate Only*

Wrestling with events, the stack, state, and the user all at once has proven
too much to keep in my head all at one time. Functional programming has
[monads][1].  [Haskell][2] programmers in particular rave about them. Inspired
by a [blog post by Patrick Thomson][3] I decided that JavaScript programmers
could use monads too. So far it is frickin awesome.
